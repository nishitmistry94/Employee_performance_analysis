# Employee_performance_analysis
<h3>
  Possible way of analysing an employee's performance demonstrated in python.
</h3>
<h1>
Concept behind this project
</h1>
<p>
On what basis a employee's performance can be judged? Obviously by how much work he does in an organisation,by how much an employee brings value to the company as.<br>
A Decimal number EPI consider it better the greater it is. With the attandance record Graph and count.
</p>
<p>
Keeping this in mind i along with my project teammate Khushil and ayush made this project
</p>
<h3>
Calculation:-
</h3>
Suppose a person is working on 3 projects in a company.<br>
1. Website Development(A Team of 3 individuals)<br>
2. Cloud services (A Team of 2 individuals)<br>
3. Site Maintanance (A Team of 4 individuals)<br>
Each with its completion time,<br>
1. 2 months<br>
2. 3 months <br>
3. 2 months<br>
and their market prices,<br>
1. 200000<br>
2. 300000<br>
3. 500000<br>

Calculating the perhead responsiblity of a employee per month:-<br> <br>
  Market Price <br>
    ÷ <br>
no of people working X Completion Time<br> 
  on this project
<br>
<br>
perhead responsiblity:-<br>
<pre>1. 33,333.33
2. 50000
3. 62500
</pre>
<b>
Total:-1,45,833.33
</b>

<p>
This Employee provides:- 1,45,833.33 of value to the companyand suppose his salary is 70000, so his 
<b>EPI is 2.08, Thus it could be said that he provides twice the amount he is paid </b>
</p>
<p>
Company can calculate the incentives,bonus according to its profit margin if a employee's epi is 2.08, company can give 1.08 X (employee's salary-company profit margin) to the empolyee
</p>
<h2>
Flaws in this idea
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
This approach is not valid for the hierarchical team we have in real life, one way to implement hierarchical model into project can be to give each person a positional constant.<br>
Eg:- manager get 1.5 constant, which means he is responsible for 1.5 times the per head responsiblitiy
</li>
<li>
By the Pareto Principle it is cleared that 80% of work is done by 20% of the people in company,thus a lazy employee may relax, while a hard working person does his work which may not give the clear picture of the worth of a employee.
</li>
</ol>
